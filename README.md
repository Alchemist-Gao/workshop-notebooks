# Workshop notebooks

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/pybamm-team/workshop-notebooks/blob/master/)

This repository contains the notebooks used in PyBaMM workshops. Note these notebooks are not maintained and may not work with the latest version of PyBaMM.

Each example was created as a _Jupyter notebook_ (http://jupyter.org/).

These notebooks can be downloaded and used locally by running
```
$ jupyter notebook
```
from your local PyBaMM repository or used online through [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/pybamm-team/workshop-notebooks/blob/master/). Note, when running via Google Colab you will need to add the line `%pip install pybamm==version` (specifying the correct version) at the start of the notebook to install PyBaMM in the notebook. Alternatively, you can simply copy/paste the relevant code.
